      "Business Problem: Hello, A little over a year ago, I quit my full time job and decided to start a business in the field of robotics/automation/software. I partner with two other amazing engineers and we have been building machines from left to right; however, the money is barely enough to keep us afloat. Even though we are very good in our field, we still struggle to deliver solutions (equipment not working as expected, software giving us trouble, or having to devote more R&D time than anticipated) and this often leads to us working longer then we expect in a project which destroys our profits. Due to this, we are now considering switching to an hourly fee for our clients. Do you guys think an hourly fee is a good option?\n",
